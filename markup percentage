/*
1. Markup
Write a program that asks the user to enter an item’s wholesale cost and its markup
percentage. It should then display the item’s retail price. For example:
• If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100%, then the
item’s retail price is 10.00.
• If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50%, then the item’s
retail price is 7.50.
The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the
wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail price
of the item.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for either the wholesale cost of the
item or the markup percentage.
