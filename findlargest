/*
Winning division
Write a program that determines which of a company's four divisions (Northeast, Southeast,
Northwest,Southwest) had the greatest sales for a quarter. It should include the following two functions,
which are called by main.

double getSales() is passed the name of a division. It asks the user for a division's quarterly sales figure,
validates the input, then returns it. It should be called once for each division.
void findlargest () is passed the four sales totals. it determines which is the largest and prints the name of the
high grossing division, along with its sales figure.

Input validation: Do not accept dollar amount less than 0.00
